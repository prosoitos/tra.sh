This project is heavily influenced by [[https://github.com/andreafrancia/trash-cli][trash-cli]], but it makes use of the power of [[https://github.com/junegunn/fzf][fzf]] and add other functionality making listing and restoring trashed files and directories particularly easy.

** Functionality and comparison with trash-cli

As with [[https://github.com/andreafrancia/trash-cli][trash-cli]], tra.sh:
- works:
   + from any mount point
   + with root privilege if necessary
- is compliant with the [[https://specifications.freedesktop.org/trash-spec/trashspec-1.0.html][FreeDesktop.org Trash specification]]
- trash directories are automatically created when required
- allows to:
   + send files/directories to trash
   + inspect the trash content
   + restore trashed files/directories
   + empty the trash fully, or selectively based on cutoff date, pattern, specific files

tra.sh differs from [[https://github.com/andreafrancia/trash-cli][trash-cli]] in the following added functionality:
- [[https://github.com/junegunn/fzf][fzf]] allows to find trashed files/directories very easily from pattern, name, path, or date
- files are listed chronologically (in reverse chronological order so that the last deleted file/directory is the easiest to access)
- trashed directories are identified with a "D" to distinguish them from trashed files
- all files in the trash are listed, even if their meta data is missing for whatever reason
- it is possible to list and restore only the files which were trashed from the current directory ([[https://github.com/andreafrancia/trash-cli][trash-cli]]'s behaviour), but it is also possible to list all files/directories in the trash and restore any of them from any directory
- trashed files can be previewed with [[https://github.com/junegunn/fzf][fzf]] with syntax highlighting
- in case of a conflict between a new file and a restored trashed file, instead of exiting with error ([[https://github.com/andreafrancia/trash-cli][trash-cli]]'s behaviour), tra.sh will restore the file and turn the already existing file into a backup file with the suffix ~~conflict-with-restored-file~
- while [[https://github.com/andreafrancia/trash-cli][trash-cli]]'s ~trash-empty~ delete files from all the trashes of all mount points (except for the root trash which requires ~sudo trash-empty~), tra.sh will empty only the trash of the current mount point. This prevents the accidental deletion of files in the trash of an external drive when cleaning the user's trash, or reciprocally, the deletion of files in the user's trash when cleaning an external drive's trash
- multiple files can be selected to be restored or cleaned from the trash at once

** Requirements

These scripts require [[https://github.com/junegunn/fzf][fzf]].

They are written on linux for zsh. Minor edits are needed for them to run in bash or other shells and on other OS (~$HOME/.local/share/Trash/files/*(D)~ to include dot files is zsh specific; ~date -d~ requires GNU date, which is not the default on macOS). I would welcome contributions to make the project portable to other shells and other OS.

** Installation

Simply clone this repository or copy these scripts in your ~$PATH~.

** Usage

Simply run any of the scripts from the command line (or from ranger, rofi, or your usual way to run commands).

You might want to set aliases (in your ~.zshrc~ file, or ~alias.zsh~ file, or ~.bashrc~ file, or wherever you normally define shell aliases). That way, you only have to call the alias to run the corresponding script.

Here are suggested aliases:

**** Send files/directories to trash

#+BEGIN_src sh
alias ts='zsh <path-to-tra.sh>/tra_sd.sh'
#+END_src

**** List trashed files/directories

- all
#+BEGIN_src sh
alias tls='zsh <path-to-tra.sh>/tra_ls.sh'
#+END_src

- only those trashed from the current directory
#+BEGIN_src sh
alias tld='zsh <path-to-tra.sh>/tra_ls_dir.sh'
#+END_src

- all, with preview
#+BEGIN_src sh
alias tlp='zsh <path-to-tra.sh>/tra_ls_p.sh'
#+END_src

- only those trashed from the current directory, with preview
#+BEGIN_src sh
alias tlb='zsh <path-to-tra.sh>/tra_ls_dir_p.sh' # b for 'both' directory and preview
#+END_src

**** Restore trashed files/directories

/Multiple files can be selected with the <tab> key in the [[https://github.com/junegunn/fzf][fzf]] drop-down list./

- any
#+BEGIN_src sh
alias trs='zsh <path-to-tra.sh>/tra_rs.sh'
#+END_src

- only those trashed from current directory
#+BEGIN_src sh
alias trd='zsh <path-to-tra.sh>/tra_rs_dir.sh'
#+END_src

- any, with preview
#+BEGIN_src sh
alias trp='zsh <path-to-tra.sh>/tra_rs_p.sh'
#+END_src

- only those trashed from current directory, with preview
#+BEGIN_src sh
alias trb='zsh <path-to-tra.sh>/tra_rs_dir_p.sh' # b for 'both' directory and preview
#+END_src

**** Clean trash

- permanently delete all files/directories in the trash
#+BEGIN_src sh
alias tcl='zsh <path-to-tra.sh>/tra_cl.sh'
#+END_src

- only delete files/directories in the trash which are n days old or older
#+BEGIN_src sh
alias tcd='zsh <path-to-tra.sh>/tra_cl_date.sh'
# Add the number of days after this command
# For example, in order to delete all files/directories 3 days old or older, type:
# tcld 3
#+END_src

**** Remove items from trash selectively

/Multiple files can be selected with the <tab> key in the [[https://github.com/junegunn/fzf][fzf]] drop-down list./

# - remove files/directories
# #+BEGIN_src sh
# alias trm='zsh <path-to-tra.sh>/tra_cl_pattern.sh'
# #+END_src

# - remove files/directories matching pattern
# #+BEGIN_src sh
# alias trp='zsh <path-to-tra.sh>/tra_cl_pattern.sh'
# #+END_src
