The idea for the behaviour of these scripts directly come from [[https://github.com/andreafrancia/trash-cli][trash-cli]]: I used and really liked trash-cli for a long time. But I wanted to make modifications to the way it lists and allows the restoration of files and, because I do not use python, I decided to write shell scripts instead.

** Differences with trash-cli

- tra.sh uses fzf to find trashed files very easily from pattern, path, or date
- Files are listed in reversed chronological order
- All files in $HOME/.local/share/Trash/files are listed and can be restored, even if their meta data in $HOME/.local/share/Trash/info is missing for whatever reason
- It is possible to only list and restore the files which were trashed from the current directory (trash-cli's behaviour), but it is also possible to list all files in the trash and restore any of them from any directory

** Requirements

These scripts require [[https://github.com/junegunn/fzf][fzf]].

** Usage

Simply run any of the scripts from the command line.

I personally use alias for them:

#+BEGIN_src sh

#+END_src
