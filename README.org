The idea for the behaviour of these scripts directly comes from [[https://github.com/andreafrancia/trash-cli][trash-cli]]: I really like trash-cli, but I wanted to make modifications to the way it lists and allows the restoration of files and, because I do not use python, I decided to write shell scripts instead. This allows for extremely easy customization and tweaking based on personal preferences.

** Differences with trash-cli

- tra.sh uses [[https://github.com/junegunn/fzf][fzf]] to find trashed files very easily from pattern, name, path, or date
- Files are listed chronologically (in reverse chronological order so that the last deleted file is the easiest one to access)
- All files in `$HOME/.local/share/Trash/files` are listed, even if their meta data in ~$HOME/.local/share/Trash/info~ is missing for whatever reason
- It is possible to only list and restore the files which were trashed from the current directory (trash-cli's behaviour), but it is also possible to list all files in the trash and restore any of them from any directory
- All trashed files go to the user's trash

** Requirements

These scripts require [[https://github.com/junegunn/fzf][fzf]].

** Usage

Simply run any of the scripts from the command line.

I personally use these aliases for them:

#+BEGIN_src sh
# 
alias tls='zsh /home/marie/bin/my_bin/tra.sh/tra_ls.sh'


#+END_src
