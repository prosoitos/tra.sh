The idea for the behaviour of these scripts directly comes from [[https://github.com/andreafrancia/trash-cli][trash-cli]]. I really like trash-cli, but I wanted to make modifications to the way it lists and allows the restoration of files. In particular, I wanted to be able to see or restore my trashed files from any directory, not just the one from which the files were trashed. I also wanted to have a better system to find the files by sorting them chronologically and by using the power of [[https://github.com/junegunn/fzf][fzf]]. Because I do not use python, I decided to write shell scripts instead.

** Differences with trash-cli

As with [[https://github.com/andreafrancia/trash-cli][trash-cli]], tra.sh allows to:
- send files and directories to trash
- see the content of the trash easily
- restore these files/directories easily
- empty the trash based on cutoff date, pattern, etc. or fully clean it

tra.sh differs from [[https://github.com/andreafrancia/trash-cli][trash-cli]] in the following:
- tra.sh uses [[https://github.com/junegunn/fzf][fzf]] to find trashed files/directories very easily from pattern, name, path, or date
- files are listed chronologically (in reverse chronological order so that the last deleted file/directory is the easiest to access)
- trashed directories are marked with "D" to distinguish them from trashed files
- all files in ~$HOME/.local/share/Trash/files~ are listed, even if their meta data in ~$HOME/.local/share/Trash/info~ is missing for whatever reason
- it is possible to list and restore only the files which were trashed from the current directory ([[https://github.com/andreafrancia/trash-cli][trash-cli]]'s behaviour), but it is also possible to list all files/directories in the trash and restore any of them from any directory
- trashed files can be previewed with [[https://github.com/junegunn/fzf][fzf]]
- in case of a conflict between a new file and a restored trashed file, instead of exiting with error ([[https://github.com/andreafrancia/trash-cli][trash-cli]]'s behaviour), tra.sh will restore the file and turn the already existing file into a backup file with the suffix ~~conflict-with-restored-file~
- all trashed files go to the user's trash

** Requirements

These scripts require [[https://github.com/junegunn/fzf][fzf]].

They are written on linux for zsh. Minor edits are likely to be necessary to run in bash or other shells (~$HOME/.local/share/Trash/files/*(D)~ to include dot files is zsh specific). ~date -d~ requires GNU date, which is not the default on macOS. On macOS, this expression will have to be changed slightly.

** Installation

Simply clone this repository or copy these scripts in your ~$PATH~.

** Usage

Simply run any of the scripts from the command line (or from ranger, rofi, or your usual way to run commands).

You might want to set aliases (in your ~.zshrc~ file, or ~alias.zsh~ file, or ~.bashrc~ file, or wherever you normally define shell aliases). That way, you only have to call the alias to run the corresponding script.

I personally use these aliases:

**** List trashed files/directories

- all
#+BEGIN_src sh
alias tls='zsh /home/marie/bin/my_bin/tra.sh/tra_ls.sh'
#+END_src

- only those trashed from the current directory
#+BEGIN_src sh
alias tlsd='zsh /home/marie/bin/my_bin/tra.sh/tra_ls_dir.sh'
#+END_src

- all, with preview
#+BEGIN_src sh
alias tlsp='zsh /home/marie/bin/my_bin/tra.sh/tra_ls_p.sh'
#+END_src

- only those trashed from the current directory, with preview
#+BEGIN_src sh
alias tlsdp='zsh /home/marie/bin/my_bin/tra.sh/tra_ls_dir_p.sh'
#+END_src

**** Restore trashed files/directories

- any
#+BEGIN_src sh
alias trs='zsh /home/marie/bin/my_bin/tra.sh/tra_rs.sh'
#+END_src

- only those trashed from current directory
#+BEGIN_src sh
alias trsd='zsh /home/marie/bin/my_bin/tra.sh/tra_rs_dir.sh'
#+END_src

- any, with preview
#+BEGIN_src sh
alias trsp='zsh /home/marie/bin/my_bin/tra.sh/tra_rs_p.sh'
#+END_src

- only those trashed from current directory, with preview
#+BEGIN_src sh
alias trsdp='zsh /home/marie/bin/my_bin/tra.sh/tra_rs_dir_p.sh'
#+END_src

**** Clean trash

- permanently delete all files/directories in the trash
#+BEGIN_src sh
alias tcl='zsh /home/marie/bin/my_bin/tra.sh/tra_cl.sh'
#+END_src

- only delete files/directories in the trash which are n days old or older
#+BEGIN_src sh
alias tcld='zsh /home/marie/bin/my_bin/tra.sh/tra_cl_date.sh'
# Add the number of days after this command
# For example, in order to delete all files/directories 3 days old or older, type:
# tcld 3
#+END_src

**** Delete specific files/directories

- any
#+BEGIN_src sh
alias tcl='zsh /home/marie/bin/my_bin/tra.sh/tra_rm.sh'
#+END_src

- any, with preview
#+BEGIN_src sh
alias tcld='zsh /home/marie/bin/my_bin/tra.sh/tra_rm_p.sh'
# Add the number of days after this command
# For example, in order to delete all files/directories 3 days old or older, type:
# tcld 3
#+END_src
